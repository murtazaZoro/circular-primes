# Circular Primes

## Problem
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below 1,000?

Please update the code in index.js to export a function that returns the number of circular primes below a number provided as a parameter.

The `npm test` command is setup to validate the solution you've developed. You can run it at any time to check whether you've completed the test successfully.

## Setup
`npm i`

## Rules
* You may approach the problem however you'd like using JavaScript (ES2015+).
* You may be able to leverage some NPM packages in the solution, but they must be approved by the moderators. External package usage will not factor into how we judge performance on the test.
* You cannot search the web for the answer to this problem, but you may lookup language or package documentation.

## Requirements
* NodeJS 10.x runtime
* NPM 6.x
